Here is a clear and complete explanation of where to do and how to do the N-Stalker web application security test, based on your Aim, Description, and Algorithm.

✅ WHERE to use N-Stalker?

N-Stalker is a Windows-based GUI tool.
So you should run it on:

✔ Windows Laptop / Desktop
✔ Windows Virtual Machine (VMware / VirtualBox)

To avoid security risk, a VM is preferable.

⚠️ Important

N-Stalker is not available on Linux and cannot run in browser or online.
You must install it locally.

📥 HOW to Install N-Stalker

Go to official website (if available) or search for
“N-Stalker Web Application Security Scanner Download”

Download the installer (.exe)

Double-click and install

Launch the application from Start menu

🧪 HOW to Perform the Web Application Scan (Step-by-step)

This is exactly what you should write in your lab manual + what you should do practically.

STEP 1 — Open N-Stalker Application

After installation, open:

N-Stalker Web Application Security Scanner

STEP 2 — Click “New Scan”

From the top menu

Select File → New Scan

A dialog box appears

STEP 3 — Enter URL

In the target field, type:

www.rajalakshmi.org


This sets your website for scanning.

STEP 4 — Choose Scan Policy

Select:

Manual Test


Then click Next.

This means:

You manually configure the test

You have full control over scanning components

STEP 5 — Click Optimize

The Optimize button:

Chooses best scanning modules

Removes unnecessary checks

Improves performance

Click Next.

STEP 6 — Start Session

Click:

Start Session


This will:

Start the session environment

Prepare crawler

Load plugins / modules

STEP 7 — Start Scan

Press:

Start Scan


N-Stalker will now do:

HTTP fingerprinting

Crawler testing

Security checks (SQL injection, XSS, etc.)

Server discovery

Fuzzing

Browser-level vulnerability checks

You can see:

Live HTTP requests

Live test progress

Identified vulnerabilities

STEP 8 — Save Scan Results

After scan completes:

File → Save Scan Result


You will get a report file (.nsr) which you can export to:

PDF

HTML

XML

📌 Your Lab Output Should Include

Screenshot of New Scan screen

Screenshot of URL entry

Screenshot of Scan Progress

Screenshot of Scan Results

Summary of vulnerabilities found



yaaraa (analysis of malware )

Here is exactly where and how you perform your YARA malware analysis for SpyEye.

✅ Where to run YARA?

You can run YARA on any of these:

✔ Kali Linux

(best for cybersecurity labs)

✔ Ubuntu / Parrot OS

(install YARA manually)

✔ Windows

(using PowerShell + pre-compiled YARA)

✔ Online YARA Playground

(for quick testing, no installation)
👉 https://yara-online.herokuapp.com

👉 https://virustotal.github.io/yara/

✔ Inside a Virtual Machine

(safest for malware)

❗ IMPORTANT

You must NOT run real malware on your main laptop.
Use a VM or cloud environment.

🧪 HOW TO DO IT — Step-by-Step Guide

Below is exact practical instructions to run your given YARA script.

🔰 STEP 1 — Install YARA
On Kali Linux / Ubuntu
sudo apt update
sudo apt install yara

On Windows

Download YARA binary:
👉 https://github.com/VirusTotal/yara/releases

Extract → open PowerShell → run yara.exe.

🔰 STEP 2 — Create your YARA rule

Create a file:

spyeye.yara


Paste the corrected script:

rule spyeye : banker
{
    meta:
        author = "Ben"
        description = "SpyEye malware detection"
        date = "2022-05-25"
        version = "1.0"
        filetype = "memory"

    strings:
        $g = "bot_version"
        $h = "bot_guid"

    condition:
        any of ($g, $h) and filesize > 50000
}


Save the file.

🔰 STEP 3 — Get a suspicious malware file

For example:

malware.exe


(Put it in the same folder as your YARA script.)

🔰 STEP 4 — Run YARA rule

Open terminal:

yara spyeye.yara malware.exe

🔰 STEP 5 — Interpret the Output
Case 1 → SpyEye detected
spyeye malware.exe

Case 2 → No output (safe file)
<no output>


That means:

File does NOT contain the SpyEye signatures

Strings were not found

Filesize condition not matched

📌 Your Lab Output Should Look Like This
[root@localhost Downloads]# ll malware.exe
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 148480 May 26 11:17 malware.exe

[root@localhost Downloads]# yara spyeye.yara malware.exe
spyeye malware.exe

🧑‍💻 Want me to generate?

I can provide:

✔ A cleaned YARA script
✔ A complete project report (AIM, Algorithm, Output)
✔ A Linux terminal output simulation
✔ A PDF of your experiment file

Just say:

👉 "Give full project report"
or
👉 "Give output screenshots"
