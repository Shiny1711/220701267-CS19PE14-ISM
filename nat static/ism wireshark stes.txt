Here is exactly where and how to find PART 7: Inspecting an HTTP GET inside Wireshark.

✅ Where is the HTTP GET message in Wireshark?

After applying your HTTP display filter, you will see a list of HTTP packets.

To inspect an HTTP GET:

✔ Step-by-Step: Finding the HTTP GET Packet
1. In the Filter bar, enter:
http && (ip.src == 169.1.19.87 || ip.dst == 169.1.19.87)


Press Enter.

Wireshark now shows only HTTP packets exchanged with your computer.

✔ 2. Look at the Packet List (top window)

This is the section where packets appear in rows.

You will see lines like:

No. | Time | Source | Destination | Protocol | Info
--------------------------------------------------------
23  | ...  | 169.1.19.87 | 128.2.x.x | HTTP | GET /Lab0/lab0.html


🔵 Look for the packet whose Protocol = HTTP and Info contains GET
Example Info field:

GET /~ini740/Lab0/lab0.html HTTP/1.1


This is your HTTP GET request.

✔ 3. Click the HTTP GET Packet

When you click it:

The middle pane (Packet Details Window) shows:

Frame

Ethernet

Internet Protocol (IP)

Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)

Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)

Expand the HTTP section using the ▼ arrow.

Inside you will see fields like:

Request Method: GET

Request URI: /~ini740/Lab0/lab0.html

Host: www.ece.cmu.edu

User-Agent

Accept

Connection

✔ 4. Minimize the other protocol layers

Click the small triangles to collapse:

Frame

Ethernet

IP

TCP

Expand only HTTP.

So your screen will show only the HTTP request details clearly.

✔ 5. Bottom window (Packet Bytes)

This shows the raw GET request in ASCII + Hex.

Example ASCII view:

GET /~ini740/Lab0/lab0.html HTTP/1.1
Host: www.ece.cmu.edu
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 ...

🎯 So, where is PART 7?

It is the exact stage where you select the first HTTP GET message from your capture:

👉 Packet List → Find HTTP GET → Click it → Expand HTTP in Packet Details

This is Part 7: Inspecting the HTTP GET message.
